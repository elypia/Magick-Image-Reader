**HEADS UP: This project is a very early work in progress and primiarly
exists for scaffolding and learning the respective APIs. You most likely
don't want to use it yet.**

## About
**Magick Image Reader** is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
which adds support for reading [over 200 image formats](https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php)
without leaving the application. It's primary use is for quickly accessing images when managing image 
repositories without the need to leave Visual Studio Code or open another program.

This project would've been a massive pain without free and open-source software
like [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) and [Magick.WASM](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.WASM) around.
If this is useful for your workflow, please also consider checking them out or sponsoring their work.
