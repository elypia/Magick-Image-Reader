# Test Assets
This folder contains images exported in many different formats, sizes, 
or with different structures such as metadata, layers, and transparency.

These are used to verify how the extension is performing manually in a real
Visual Studio Code instance in order to witness bugs, or performance.

Assets used for testing:

## Formats
Regarding image file formats, this may include many double ups of the same format
such as JPEG, JPG, and JPE, in order to be absolutely sure all extensions
will be read correctly.

## Integration Testing
This defines the integration tests, when or if bugs are discovered, a document
which can reproduce the problem will be placed here to allow testing if this works, 
and continues to work.
